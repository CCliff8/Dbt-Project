This repository is the result of completing the dbt Fundamentals course, where I learned to connect dbt Cloud to a data warehouse and Git repository. The course covers essential concepts such as modeling, sources, testing, documentation, and deployment. Throughout the course, I gained hands-on experience by building a model and running tests in dbt Cloud.

### Project Overview
In this project, I utilized the jaffle-shop dataset, which is stored in Amazon S3 and has been uploaded to Snowflake. This setup allows for efficient data transformation and analysis using dbt.

### Key Concepts Learned
**Connecting dbt Cloud**: Set up dbt Cloud with a data warehouse and Git repository to streamline data workflows. <br />
**Modeling**: Developed my first dbt model, understanding how to structure and optimize data transformations. <br />
**Sources**: Learned to define and manage data sources, ensuring accurate data ingestion. <br />
**Testing**: Implemented tests to validate data integrity and quality, ensuring reliable outputs. <br />
**Documentation**: Created documentation for the dbt project, enhancing clarity and maintainability. <br />
**Deployment**: Explored deployment strategies to effectively manage and execute dbt models in production environments. <br />

### Future Work
I plan to continue building on this project by exploring additional dbt courses and implementing personal projects that leverage the skills I've acquired. This will include further enhancing data models, expanding testing coverage, and improving documentation practices.
